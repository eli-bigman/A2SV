Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Yeah, again. Now what size for you OK? Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Sing a song about this question. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Bing. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Cortana. Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. How do you play? Suggests converted away to their upper cases, everything to lower case and the the ones that are no operates. Just get something like. Hey, Cortana. You can just sit from Google Chrome. What will the time is this? Make it one. Triple. Triple. This is something that you need to optimize. You end up using as smart or and then finally we have one that is just master. So now it doesn't need any special going like you look at it to be like this thing. Like. That question. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Smoke, smoke TOC. Smoke me. Superman. Hey, Cortana. Change the. Hey, Cortana. Just for problem. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Yeah. I didn't explain. Where did you match down in Southampton? You have to arrange this one such that they so here we have to to all to scan 1st, then next is one all ones, therefore all fours 3 or 3 9 all nights six or six. Now the elements are here and I know here we are in the Monday. So your boss helps in the end. Indian electric help model one Indian if it's a detailed area pendant index of experience and take two and I added since 3 here you can listen to added last one we added the index of two yeah so we have to be able to get this up to here and then we add 1 to it then you set. So you did this one, yeah, elements from finally index excess in here OK. Then you set its clause one. India finds ways to split. What's the? What's the? Hello. The second I want to so I have. For every elements in this area I want to put it in my appendix in my new alley this number of times. So. So why and then? Because this is a counter. Yeah, and. Tagging was a job Decision 1231 problem with suit naha votes Shunsman for Calvinism of. Search SO for this in Dubai. Two appears. I want to just open this three times for one over here. I want to attend this box for 4 over the I want to attend this one. One for 6 one. 10. 6. Is it going today? So it's increasing? Yes. Elements that do not appear in our resolution OK. We know it's just saying that you have to put some other and. Face. These are the one that for the second one. So for you. Just pin them over here in their socks and come and just add it over here. We just try to attend this directly here and sort it mess. I don't know how we can. Get it from here. How do we get it in here? This is necessary. Yeah. This. Is not. We always eat this and not bugs or eggs here that are not here. Like two distance to 4 that is in here and it is not safe since you are going to have this when you have this right. And we check there. So you take this like the east of this. It's like you think he is this to you, baby. Appendix. If it doesn't exist. If I move to move forward. 124. Yes, I know the elements that are. Here. We can just subtract it. So now this. Yeah, we can just remove it. Hey, Cortana. Yeah. Shall I get? This one. 24202. I am in zombie for ice cream and greenhouse even though I am groceries everyone. Yeah, use that so I can see. I don't know. Hey, Cortana. Check the key. India's RSC warehouse without India. In Narayan. The number is what you're adding the number. You can access the number in the listing by doing the number. So hash mark was the number this device this number. This this link is given. This means based on this so for number for every number, for every number in this part. What is the logic? What is the logic? For every number in this one. Multiplying by. 1. Yes. Hey, Cortana. Fault in a Hajma. Your brain is. Like. The same side of the grid. Retain the hash mark. Let's see if it can actually just retain the. Printing today, yeah. Mamata Banerjees, National Attributes. The president. In my list 'cause we have a multiple. Integrity. It doesn't work like. We're not checking the number is. The size of the row and then you run that. So this would be. Yes. Reminder to go to the number of. It was a skill for everything the number should be. Open open square. When is the song? Plus one right size plus one. Three equal 01238010. So with that they will come as was. The answer has a restriction that because if I go to the next element and I remove. I think they want us to remove 4 and here at the same time. We do this, we are just going to check it OK. For I in range of one size. Three times. The first time we're meeting that. Dennis, what if I have? Just. So important to set this is going to be this thing. So it's going to be for every element that is not in this added to our 2nd distance sort of. Forget this sense. Forget this sense. Hey, Cortana. Play mix is it has to take us for me. What's the use of the Facebook the last? Element with this logic. Hey Cortana fix the number like it is also in this technology this this this is trying to print out my the number is not in this then just. Push the phone, give me a name and I read. Hey, Cortana. We want to do it three times right? So we want this to repeat three times. Should be above the this main for loop. Yeah, to make the set. So. We are checking. The number. Then you are creating a counter sense to this account and then. Now this one. Works for adding it inside this one. Yeah, so now for every elements in one. Device. The first one was just doing. You have a temporary. Then just add it to our bigger one. I want to check if every element is true. If the two is not inside this one, but this 2 is inside, right escape is this 3 is inside escape it. Which ones are inside which I'm going to listen to? Every element for every number for element. This is our element 124 row size equal to length of so that is inside the tree. Ellen dot store is 1124 wildlife, so why didn't you know that? So for everyone. To make. For this I'm going to have this time. Theme tune yours. Kabhi's Kumbh gets a dust, mambojet gets sends. Yay. This one is just going to add. Just going to create to create more but we are using Android one which I'm talking about. Run instructors going to add or it's not even going to. So that means you need to add this seven business. So what's if we add that if that if it is not? The first pass. Because it's going to be more than a joint. Doesn't say. Yeah. So how do you compare the code to bring it to the back of? All right, that's going to break it up. This was supposed to be yours. Yeah, it's always recent. If you declare a variable but you're not using it, yeah, that's all. That is concerned. Again, but I'm getting I guess, I guess, I guess. What's in my best station? II just added the final answer. So outputs plus then you got sort of OK that's. Alright then. You doesn't sort it doesn't. It doesn't return anything. So at this point. I assume she just. Over here, no like no here just explain. But then so doesn't retain anything so you have to use this. For her, yeah, totally works. So. Let's use this logic. Where the number in everyone. Faizabad outskirts. Everyone to give the number is not in array to the sets of array 2. So you skip. Now times. I think it's. The number two times. Or is this budget? Laptop. I think it's. Make sense, but I think it's OK. You guys just so two, so two, I guess I'll talk to three times over here. So we're going to go to, to, to. We've seen it. Do it for every number so it takes this the output this time. You done it, yeah. Let's let's go with the wolf and squared. And then anytime you can let me see the constraints. There is there is a factor in question. So what would be most questions which must be your face on that side? So we do this. To check this before you add it to this. Initialize the variable or do we need to resolve initialize the variable? So this is going to create a. This way to create. If. You should reduce the appliance. That's the same thing if you check inside this, you also have to check it is already inside this, otherwise if it comes to misconception. That was a problem. What about? This. The second one is. Then we are supposed to. So we like this sentence. So this is the same. So otherwise the return list. Of OK the numbers here by India. So for this Council conference we can call and nephew's one nexplanon order. For all the source do you order please and I order please. Add them to kills Buddhist shortage in assembly kebab. So that's that's that's what you're supposed to pretend the outer length. So we're thinking that there's desperate accounts there the frequency of their obtain them inside. What's the temperature? So we will be adding the numbers times their frequency in the folder so like. We just added three times, but the problem you're having right now is that when. Yes. We have to invest. Igate. Something to drop. OK. Hey Cortana, search again. To track the earnings so we can check out so to be poor. Alright, so you have a sense. Credit number. Continue with this. OK now you have to add that I have to add the number to this team. So you can wait. So there before, so how we add them? I think you just put it down because as long as it doesn't. Seem that bad? Yeah. This is the. So every Mumbai. And I think it's not going, it's supposed to be supposed to be for every number in this one, right? It's not going in this world. But if we do that is going to change. Every number is going to end here. Yeah, that's, that's the thing. So that is going to end here. Then now we can come and do. We don't need the. Put their meaning numbers and then you sort it. No this will be inside the. This is checking for all the numbers and considering the number is not. OK. I'm interested for me. And then it runs again. So it repeats this should be three times and it goes. Please define. Instead of checking out. That's why. We want to run it on. 8.4. Yeah it is an awful open this this will be working, no? This problem is the weather in this evening. It worked. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So. Well, the second one. Bye Grease. That's why we needed that. We needed a report. We got some of this one. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. So he's not doing. So the present just appended the one driver. Is the best sound function. Is using apps you add to the second dyslexic? Alright, so let's move on to the last one. Hey, Cortana. What's a? Hey Cortana, add maximum of deleted to the answer. So index will delete the greatest elements. If you delete the greatest element, then add the maximum code elements of all the three rules to answer a way or something like that. Hey Cortana because if you have three rules they are deleting less than 12. 3. So. Wow. Hey, Cortana. Anytime you take a room, just. Find a marketplace. When we take the element, we take a month. And then when you come, it's Wendy. Like wait I think the water grid, the stone element in the green we set a marketed by the and we take a role in the if the if the million of elements we find the marks between the Pope because where it is going to pop the highest point. We take it. Hey, Cortana, can we go to the next? Do you do it anytime? It doesn't. Score and forward to the last four. If you have the same values it will still add to four different. Instead of this instead of 2 and 4 and 3 then you would have to add it forward. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. How do you like? Hey, Cortana. Select. This. Is a great number. Inside what I did face at this point for everything here, we saw it now. And then we sets off hundred 62. So now since we have the same size and we are doing like if we do something to the one we do it for the. Just need to check for. That there's there's an, there's an element. So now for the facebook in a grid if this elements. We find a Max value between this zero and the Max value after we pull it. Jeez, your roof and after you would look on the human so. When we pop do, we compare, they will update, they will go to the next game, see if there's still a marks that we update. Go again. After you get done everything here, then we can ask that value to the answer. Then I'll first we did a pop it shrink all the sizes by one. So then we go to the do the same thing for the next part. So it is on the Republican. Because there's wow. The group is there, while it's the rule in the greatest audience. That's what they face. Yeah, well, this one citizen. Is checking people like an element exists in the facebook? So what we're checking again if if you if an element of this sometimes we were like the numbers can exist twice and it's it's really you have to. Yeah, just please go. It wasn't fast for this issue so I just needed it to pass over the test. I use a fascism to explain it. Then we find a Max between to our Max related ones. There, so you find this was cool. If you. This and then OK before we need to go to the monsoon. Hey, Cortana. 4 and 3. Elements in the last one. Since this one is still an elementary. With this, everything is shrinking. Everything. Hey, Cortana. Shut it down. It shut me down. One hour. Oh, then it just one secret. Yeah, that's one thing I am missing. You can just do a simple. String then you do. Who empowered you? So simple. Let's tell you where the next element is. I'll just sit there, point at this one here, now update this to here and I'll take out the data strategy track of this one's pointer. So I like get to a point, I have to update it again. I just have it. Yeah. But then I'm like seeing that is the link. The value is the current value, the next appointment. It's an easy problem. So you pick the value, compare which one is better. If it's greater, you put it to the next or. You always have to keep it in front of you. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Find the English of the face of current search. Yeah. Hey, Cortana. Take a length of this train. Is it out with? You. Yes. I get to see what's going to. Hey Cortana, for cancer in string to make it a little bit. Strength it's day list, so converting their empty list list is equal to. This compression. For asking if your strings name is sings, so for character in a string. So S for K for X for X, and strength. I stole this compression, right? OK so OK. What is it? Call also dispatcher outlook, at least when I said. Later, later for I. Left at the step is the letter to the needle. Slice check. It. I just retained it. Back I don't like. How much time? Hey, Cortana. VSOP. Leader. Hey Cortana, play index paste. Hey, Cortana. Set a link. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Park coat. Cortana have a pizza day. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. How do I get an appointment today? How do I get back to? I want. To. Hey, Cortana. 0413. Square. Accounts. Yes, we have to subtract that. Hey, Cortana. So when is the square matrix? Yeah. Hey, Cortana, what is? Duck Duck Condition is after you download your song. Yeah. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. 10 - 1. - 5. Chopra's fate place. What do you think about them? So the first one? Is always. Took a long time. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Did you really like to the family? Read the phone number. I did the. Material. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. I don't think it goes to the end of the meeting. Hey, Cortana. Plus one desktop. If they start to slay, the village of their window sighs. Then I can. Then I can do this. Start start plus windows size minus one, yeah. So it's always shift on the Windows side, start start plus windows sign minus one. So window size minus one. I want to ship this on the start index, that's the amount of money. One by one if you want to slide by the window size, maybe if the thing is just at the next value. They also slide by one. I just like we can move by one you you feel based on the window size. So in this case. Oh yeah, XML. So I can't start. I start at the start point and I start. One, unless you're looking at a three letter way. Let's yeah, let's know how we have. Mine is one because yeah, I believe that's this one. This will ignore the last reach. So start password. Hi. Shut up. Hey, Cortana. Report. Will you be home? Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Where is the voice? Hey. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Who? Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hello. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana.

Hey Cortana, since morning my phone search I was just like 5:00 I bet I didn't even understand this. 2 point is you understand. Explain it too much. I don't think I'm sliding. Oh, what's your name? Hi. You wake up, I read. It's probably nice to soak this one alright. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. I beg you, I beg you. Oh my God. Beggar. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana play. Some girl. Hey, Cortana, what a game. Yeah, thummy crab. It's like I don't want. Oh, **** Are you? Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana.
